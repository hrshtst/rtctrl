 (roki, zm,…)   control table, conversions
```

- **`dxl/` — motor communication.** `PacketIO` is the abstract
  transaction seam (ping/read/write/syncRead/syncWrite). `Port`
  implements it over DynamixelSDK; the emulator implements it twice
  for tests. `SyncGroup` programs the servos' indirect-address banks
  so one sync-read fetches position/velocity/current/voltage/
  temperature for the whole group and one sync-write sets the goals.
  `control_table.hpp`/`conversions.hpp` fix the XM register map and
  raw-unit conversions (incl. per-model torque constants).
- **`model/` — kinematics and dynamics.** RAII wrappers over mi-lib's
  C API: `ChainModel` (load `.ztk`, FK, gravity torque, inverse
  dynamics), `JointMap` (coordinate/force mappings), `IkSolver`
  (error-damped LM with structured `IkResult`), trajectories, `.zvs`
  motion logging for `rk_anim`.
- **`arm/` — the bridge.** `Arm` (activate/deactivate/setMode/
  readState/writeCommand/step), `Controller` + `run()`, the two
  implementations `SimArm`/`RealArm`, and the shipped controllers
  `GravityComp` and `ComputedTorque`.
- **`hw/` — the real robot.** `Config` (TOML), `CraneX7` (activation
  sequence, mode-checked limited writers, background RW thread,
  deadman), consumed by `RealArm`.
- **`emu/` — the test double.** One control-table state machine, two
  transports. Not linked into controllers; linked into tests and the
  standalone `dxl_emu`.

Dependency rule: `dxl` and `model` are independent of each other;
`arm` depends on `model`; `hw` depends on `dxl` + `model` + `arm`;
`emu` depends only on `dxl` types. Controllers depend on `arm` (and
`model` for dynamics) — never on `dxl`/`hw` directly.

## Canonical coordinates

One joint order is fixed project-wide (`model::canonicalJoints()`):

| canonical | joint | DXL id | servo |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | shoulder pan | 2 | XM430-W350 |
| 1 | shoulder tilt | 3 | XM540-W270 |
| 2 | upper-arm twist | 4 | XM430-W350 |
| 3 | elbow | 5 | XM430-W350 |
| 4 | forearm twist | 6 | XM430-W350 |
| 5 | wrist pitch | 7 | XM430-W350 |
| 6 | wrist rotate | 8 | XM430-W350 |
| 7 | gripper (finger A) | 9 | XM430-W350 |

The roki model has a ninth joint (finger B, mimicking A).
`JointMap` resolves model indices **by link name at load time** and
provides `expand` ($q_9 = E q_8$), `reduce`, and `reduceTorque`
($\tau_8 = E^\mathsf{T}\tau_9$) — see
[dynamics foundations](../theory/dynamics-foundations.md). Every
`JointState`/`JointCommand` on the bridge is canonical 8-DOF; only
`SimArm`/`RealArm` translate at their boundaries.

## The bridge contract

```cpp
class Arm {
  int dof();                    // 8
  double dt();                  // control period
  bool activate();              // torque on, safety armed, NO motion
  bool deactivate();            // gentle release — NOT an e-stop
  bool setMode(ControlMode);    // Position=3 / Velocity=1 / Current=0
  bool readState(JointState&);  // q, dq, tau (est.), t
  bool writeCommand(const JointCommand&);
  bool step();                  // sim: integrate dt; real: wait cycle
};
```

One cycle is `readState → Controller::update → writeCommand → step`
(`arm::run`). `SimArm` integrates plain-roki forward dynamics,
$(M + \mathrm{diag}\,J_r)\,\ddot q = \tau - b$, with reflected motor
inertia $J_r$, semi-implicit Euler, inelastic joint stops, and an
overdamped equal-and-opposite finger coupling. `RealArm` rides `CraneX7`'s
background thread: `step()` blocks on the next completed
read→limit→write cycle.

## Safety architecture (hardware)

Two independent watchdog layers, because each alone has a blind spot:

1. **Servo-side Bus Watchdog** (register 98, armed at activation,
   firmware ≥ v38 enforced): the servo freezes itself — motion halted,
   goal writes locked out, **torque stays on** — when no instruction
   packet arrives in time. Covers host death and cable loss. Blind
   spot: *any* packet feeds it, so a host whose reads continue while
   command writes stall never trips it.
2. **Host-side deadman**: tracks the time since the last *successful
   command write*; on staleness it best-effort zeroes/torque-offs and
   then **silences the bus entirely** (closes the port) — which
   guarantees layer 1 fires even if the safety writes themselves were
   failing.

The activation sequence additionally verifies servo models and
firmware, clears previously tripped watchdogs, snaps goals to the
present posture, and applies soft-start gains. Command writers clamp
against position/velocity/effort limits and reject mode-mismatched or
feedback-less commands. All of it is asserted in tests whose
acceptance criterion is the *emulated motor's end state*, and was
drilled on the physical arm (USB pull → freeze within 100 ms).

`deactivate()` is not an emergency stop. Hardware sessions require an
independent actuator-power cutoff within reach
([bring-up checklist](../HARDWARE_BRINGUP.md)).

## Verification tiers

| Tier | Command | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| unit | `ctest -L unit` | pure logic + in-process emulator |
| integration | `ctest -L integration` | wire-level emulator through the real SDK; roki dynamics sim |
| hardware | staged apps | the physical checklist + controller phases |

CI runs the first two from a clean clone, including the mi-lib
bootstrap.
