# CRANE-X7 Control Library (rtctrl) — Project Plan

## Context

This repo will host a new control library for the CRANE-X7 7-DOF arm (RT Corporation).
The vendor lib `rt_manipulators_cpp` is poorly structured, its IK is numerically unstable,
and it offers no current-based torque control. The new library covers all vendor features,
delegates kinematics/dynamics/simulation to mi-lib (roki/roki-fd), uses DynamixelSDK for
motor comms, and provides a **bridge** so a controller runs unchanged against the roki-fd
simulator and the real robot. Reference repos (`rt_manipulators_cpp/`, `crane_x7_ros/`,
`mi-lib-tutorial/`) will be deleted later; `third_party/*` submodules stay.

**User decisions (2026-07-17):** C++17, CMake, Catch2. mi-lib's zeda-makefile-gen/autotest
explicitly rejected as too complicated. Config files in **TOML** (not YAML). Third-party
retrieval: submodules and FetchContent **combined** by rule (see Build design). Python
utilities run with **uv** and carry a `pyproject.toml`.

**Key facts verified during exploration:**
- roki ships a URDF converter: `urdf2ztk` CLI (`third_party/roki/app/urdf2ztk.c`) and
  `rkChainReadURDF`/`rkURDFWriteZTK` (`rk_chain_urdf.h`); roki built with `CONFIG_USE_URDF=y`.
  Mesh `import` paths pass through verbatim (`rk_chain_urdf.c:644-651`) and zeo opens them
  CWD-relative with `fopen`; `package://` URIs must be rewritten. zeo reads ASCII+binary STL
  (`zeo/include/zeo/zeo_ph3d_stl.h`).
- mi-lib is installed under `$HOME/usr` with `<lib>-config` scripts (no CMake/pkg-config);
  `urdf2ztk`, `rk_pen`, `rk_anim` are in `~/usr/bin`.
- DynamixelSDK `c++/CMakeLists.txt` is a modern package: target **`dynamixel_sdk`** (shared,
  C++17, PIC), `install(EXPORT dynamixel_sdkTargets)` — usable via `add_subdirectory`.
  Its `dynamixel_easy_sdk` has NO indirect-address support → build on the low-level API
  (PortHandler/PacketHandler 2.0/GroupSync(Fast)Read/Write).
- `PortHandlerLinux` supports 3 Mbps via standard `B3000000` termios constant → a pty-based
  bus emulator works with the unmodified SDK.
- XM servos have a servo-side **Bus Watchdog** (register 98, 1 byte, 20 ms units; requires
  firmware ≥ v38; `third_party/DynamixelSDK/control_table/xm430_w350.model:51` + official
  XM430 e-manual): it monitors ALL instruction packets — if none arrives within the timeout
  the servo stops itself and rejects goal writes until cleared. The only mechanism that
  still works once USB/host communication is lost. Caveat: ongoing sync reads keep it fed
  even when the write path stalls, so a host-side stale-command check is still required.
- roki's `rkChainID_G` requires non-null, correctly sized velocity/acceleration vectors:
  `rkChainSetJointRateAll` unconditionally indexes both (`rk_chain.c:478`, `:334`).
- `rk_chain_urdf.c:398`: the converter drops URDF effort/velocity limits — they must be
  carried separately (see M1).
- Robust IK requirement met by roki: `rkChainIK(chain, dis, tol, iter)` with error-damped
  solver (`rkChainIKSetEquationSolverED`), prioritized/weighted constraint cells.
- roki-fd sim template: `third_party/roki-fd/example/chain/arm_box_trq_test.c`
  (rkFDCreate → rkFDChainRegFile → rkFDContactInfoScanFile → ODE2Assign/PrpSetDT/SetSolver
  → rkFDUpdate loop; torque via `rkJointMotorSetInput`; writes .zvs each step).
- Catch2 NOT installed as system package → FetchContent. (yaml-cpp 0.8 is installed but
  unused — config format is TOML per user decision.)
- Hardware: DXL IDs 2–8 (arm) + 9 (gripper finger_a; finger_b mimics, no servo). Joint 2 =
  XM540-W270 (2.409 Nm/A), others XM430-W350 (1.783 Nm/A). 3 Mbps, /dev/ttyUSB0. Joint 4
  range -161°..0°, velocity limit 4.817 rad/s. roki has no mimic joints.

## Architecture

Library name/namespace **`rtctrl`**, CMake target `rtctrl::rtctrl`. Four layers +
emulator; `dxl` and `model` are independent, `arm` depends on `model`, `hw` on all.

**Bridge interface (the load-bearing design):** controllers implement
`Controller::update(const JointState&, JointCommand&, double t)`; `Runner` drives any `Arm`.
`SimArm` wraps the roki dynamics (planned as roki-fd; built on plain `rkChainFD` — see the
M3 deviation note); `CraneX7Hardware` implements the
same interface on real hardware (`step()` blocks on the RW-thread cycle tick). Same
controller binary verifies in sim, then runs on the robot — PLAN.md's bridge requirement.

**Canonical coordinates (defined in M1, before any controller code):** the system spans
three spaces — 7 arm joints + 1 gripper at the controller, 8 servos (DXL IDs 2–9) on the
bus, 9 revolute joints (7 arm + finger_a + finger_b) in the roki model. Canonical order:
indices 0–6 = arm joints 1–7 (IDs 2–8), index 7 = gripper (ID 9 / finger_a).
`JointState`/`JointCommand`/`Arm::dof()` are always canonical 8-DOF. `model/joint_map.hpp`
owns the explicit mappings — canonical↔DXL ID, canonical↔roki joint index resolved by link
NAME via `rkChainFindLink` at load time (never hardcoded ordinals) — plus the gripper
expansion to finger_a/finger_b. `SimArm`/`RealArm` translate at their boundaries only.

**Mimic finger_b (coupling, not copying):** finger_b stays a real revolute joint in the
.ztk (correct mass/collision for sim). `SimArm` enforces the mechanical linkage as a
penalty constraint: coupling torque τ_c = −K(q_b−q_a) − C(q̇_b−q̇_a) applied **equal and
opposite** (+τ_c on finger_b, −τ_c on finger_a) each step, with the commanded gripper
effort split symmetrically. Reported
gripper state = finger_a. Acceptance test (M3): under asymmetric contact (one finger
blocked), |q_b−q_a| stays under a documented threshold; the residual divergence is
documented as a model limitation. Finger joints get zero IK weight.

## Build design

- **mi-lib:** `cmake/FindMiLib.cmake` with components
  (`find_package(MiLib REQUIRED COMPONENTS roki roki-fd dzco liw)`): per component,
  `find_program(<lib>-config HINTS $ENV{HOME}/usr/bin)`, run `--cflags`/`-l` via
  `execute_process`, split into INTERFACE include dirs/definitions/link dirs/libs, create
  `MiLib::<lib>` INTERFACE IMPORTED target. The -config scripts are transitive already.
- **DynamixelSDK:** `add_subdirectory(third_party/DynamixelSDK/c++ EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)`, link
  target `dynamixel_sdk`. Ignore its `CONTROL_TABLE_PATH` define (invalid un-installed).
  (Planned .model cross-check path dropped — see the M4 deviation note.)
  Avoid `dynamixel_easy_sdk` headers entirely.
- **Config format: TOML** via **toml++ (tomlplusplus), pinned GIT_TAG v3.4.0** —
  decided, header-only C++17, FetchContent. Schema mirrors rt_manipulators' shape (joint groups,
  sync signals, per-joint id/model/mode/margins) as `[[...]]` tables. ZTK stays for what
  mi-lib owns (robot model, contact info, .zvs). No yaml-cpp dependency.
- **Catch2 via FetchContent, pinned GIT_TAG v3.7.1** + CTest; labels `unit` (fast,
  in-process) and `integration` (pty/sim). C++17 everywhere.
- **Third-party retrieval policy (submodules + FetchContent combined, by rule):**
  *submodule* = pinned sources needed in-tree — mi-lib libs (built/installed to $HOME/usr
  outside our CMake), DynamixelSDK (built via add_subdirectory; its `control_table/*.model`
  data files are consumed at runtime by dxl_inspect, so a stable in-source path matters),
  crane_x7_description (model source data for the port pipeline, not a build dep).
  *FetchContent* = pure build/test-time deps our CMake builds itself — Catch2, toml++.
  All FetchContent deps pinned to exact tags; mi-lib pinned by submodule SHAs.
- **Clean-clone reproducibility:** `tools/bootstrap_milib.sh` builds/installs the mi-lib
  submodules in dependency order (zeda → zm → zeo → dzco → roki → roki-fd → liw → zx11 →
  roki-gl) into `MILIB_PREFIX` (default `$HOME/usr`). `FindMiLib.cmake` fails with an
  actionable message pointing at the script when a `<lib>-config` is missing. CI exercises
  bootstrap + build + `ctest -L unit` from a clean clone.
- **Python utilities:** `uv`-managed; `tools/pyproject.toml` declares xacro + rospkg;
  scripts run via `uv run` (no global pip installs, no manual venvs).

## Motor mock/emulator (TDD)

One state-machine core `emu::MotorEmulator`, two transports:
1. **FakePacketIO** (implements `dxl::PacketIO`) — in-process, for fast unit tests of
   SyncGroup/CraneX7Hardware logic.
2. **Pty bus emulator** (`apps/dxl_emu.cpp`) — `posix_openpt`, parses Protocol 2.0 frames
   (Ping/Read/Write/SyncRead 0x82/SyncWrite 0x83/FastSyncRead 0x8A, CRC-16 per
   `protocol2_packet_handler.cpp`), so the *unmodified* SDK PortHandler connects to it.
   Integration tests + offline demos of all apps.

Emulator rules: EEPROM & OperatingMode writes rejected while TorqueEnable=1 (error 0x07);
mode-dependent goal register validity; `tick(dt)` motion sim (mode 3: first-order toward
goal clamped by Profile Velocity/Acceleration; mode 1: integrate; mode 0: PresentCurrent =
GoalCurrent + optional 1-DOF inertia); indirect data reads redirect through IndirectAddress
(168+/224+); position/current/velocity limits clamp goals; HardwareErrorStatus injectable;
**Bus Watchdog (98)**: armed value counts 20 ms units; the emulator timestamps EVERY
instruction packet (reads included, per the XM430 e-manual) — silence past the timeout
stops motion and rejects goal writes (error status) until cleared by writing 0. Tests must
cover the trap case: continuous sync reads with stalled writes must NOT trip it.

## Milestones (each PR-sized, independently verifiable)

**M0 — Scaffolding.** Repo layout, root CMakeLists, FindMiLib.cmake (actionable
missing-prerequisite errors), `tools/bootstrap_milib.sh`, DynamixelSDK add_subdirectory,
pinned Catch2/toml++ FetchContent, smoke test (`rkChainInit` + PacketHandler ctor), CI
workflow.
✓ Clean-clone CI: bootstrap → `cmake -B build && cmake --build build && ctest --test-dir
build` green; same sequence green locally.

**M1 — Model port (URDF → .ztk → rk_pen).** `tools/` uv project (`pyproject.toml` with
xacro + rospkg) providing `port_model.py`, run as `uv run port_model`:
`ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=third_party xacro .../crane_x7.urdf.xacro use_gazebo:=false
use_d435:=false use_mock_components:=true` → flat URDF; rewrite
`package://crane_x7_description/meshes` → `models/crane_x7/meshes`; `urdf2ztk`; merge
`crane_x7_motor.patch.ztk` ([roki::motor] type `trq` per driven joint — direct-drive,
torque constants live in `hw/conversions.hpp` not the ztk). The URDF DOES carry nominal
per-joint damping/friction (`crane_x7_arm.xacro:110`; gripper too) but urdf2ztk does not
preserve them — ztk friction starts at ZERO (optionally seeded from those URDF nominals),
refined by M7 identification.
urdf2ztk drops URDF velocity/effort limits (`rk_chain_urdf.c:398`), so author them into
`config/crane_x7.toml` (velocity 4.817 rad/s all joints; effort 10/10/4/4/4/4/4/4 Nm) —
enforced by trajectory clamp, `hw/safety.hpp`, and `SimArm`; a test verifies the TOML
values against the URDF source. Also in M1: **canonical joint order +
`model/joint_map.hpp`** (name-resolved via `rkChainFindLink`), with round-trip tests.
✓ Manual: `rk_pen models/crane_x7/crane_x7.ztk` from repo root. Catch2: load succeeds,
joint count, joint-4 limits ≈[-161°,0°], total mass = URDF sum, FK zero-pose wrist height,
joint-map round-trips (canonical↔ID↔roki index), limits TOML = URDF values.

**M2 — Simple motion → .zvs → rk_anim.** `trajectory.hpp` (min-jerk + sinusoid, 4.817 rad/s
clamp), `zvs_writer.hpp` (`fprintf` dt + `zVecFPrint` per line), `examples/make_motion.cpp`.
`IkSolver` returns a structured `IkResult` (converged flag derived from position/
orientation residuals vs tolerance, iteration count, joint-limit satisfaction) — never a
bare vector. IK acceptance (the "robust IK" criterion): reachable poses — including
selected reachable singular/near-singular configurations, exactly where the error-damped
solver must prove its robustness — → converged, residual < 1e-4 m / 1e-3 rad, within
limits; unreachable targets or incompatible constraints → explicit non-convergence status
(finite result, no NaN, flagged as failure — a finite-but-wrong answer must not pass).
✓ Manual: `rk_anim models/crane_x7/crane_x7.ztk build/motion.zvs`. Catch2: trajectory
boundary conditions, velocity-limit property, zvs re-parse.

**M3 — sim side of bridge (DONE, with deviations).** `arm/` layer (types, Arm, SimArm,
Runner), `contactinfo.ztk`. All four acceptance tests pass.
*Deviations found necessary during implementation:*
- **SimArm uses plain roki `rkChainFD` + semi-implicit Euler, not roki-fd.** For this
  contact-free chain, roki-fd left the chain's per-joint dis/vel as solver-stage workspace
  (reads after `rkFDUpdate` were inconsistent with committed state) and its cell state
  showed unphysical finger velocities. Plain FD keeps state committed by construction.
  roki-fd returns when contact-rich scenes arrive (grasping/tables); `contactinfo.ztk`
  is retained for that.
- **Reflected motor inertia (gear²·J_rotor ≈ 0.05 kg·m², estimate) is added to the
  mass-matrix diagonal** via `rkChainInertiaMatBiasVecG` + own Gauss solve. Without it the
  bare finger inertia (~3e-5 kg·m²) under the ±4 Nm effort clamp produces kHz chatter no
  real geared servo exhibits. Value refined at M7 identification.
- ztk Coulomb friction is NOT emitted by the port (roki-fd applies joint friction only to
  dc motors; with trq motors the value leaks as a constant torque); a small inertia-scaled
  viscous term stands in until M7.
- Finger coupling overdamped (couple_c dominates) — the effort clamp turns a lightly
  damped stiff spring into a bang-bang limit cycle otherwise. Static divergence matches
  the constraint analysis (0.0084 rad at 0.5 Nm asymmetric load).

**M4 — DXL comm layer + emulator + inspection tool (DONE, two intentional deviations).**
`dxl/` layer (PacketIO, Port,
ControlTable, SyncGroup with indirect addressing: one FastSyncRead covering
pos/vel/current/voltage/temp, one SyncWrite); `MotorEmulator` + FakePacketIO; pty
`dxl_emu`; `dxl_inspect` (bus scan, read/write named or raw registers, dump-all,
cross-check against SDK `.model` files).
*Deviations (intentional, per post-completion review):* the built layer uses ordinary
`GroupSyncRead`, not FastSyncRead — one indirect-bank read still fetches all signals in a
single transaction and sustains 100 Hz over 8 servos at 3 Mbps with zero overruns, so the
fast variant stayed an unneeded optimization (the emulator parses 0x8A regardless). And
`dxl_inspect` cross-checks against `control_table.hpp` (the project's single source of
truth for the register map) rather than parsing SDK `.model` files; the CMake model-dir
variable this planned for was removed as dead config.
✓ Catch2 unit (Fake): torque gating, mode rules, indirect redirect, unit round-trips.
Integration (pty): real PortHandler @3 Mbps scan finds IDs 2–9, one-transaction multi-signal
read, fault injection → SDK timeout surfaced. Manual: `dxl_emu & dxl_inspect --port
/tmp/ttyDXL scan|dump` offline.

**M5 — Hardware bring-up (DONE — all checklist steps confirmed on the real arm).**
*Hardware findings:* DynamixelSDK leaves the port at a garbage speed on glibc ≥ 2.42
(setupPort never calls cfsetispeed/ospeed) — dxl::Port reasserts the line settings; the
Bus Watchdog freezes the arm with torque ON (it does not go limp) and activation now
clears tripped watchdogs before its goal snap; dialout membership is mandatory (session
ACLs do not survive the drill's replug). Servos: fw v47, ids/models exactly per config.
`hw/config.hpp` + `config/crane_x7.toml`, `hw/safety.hpp`, minimal `crane_x7.cpp`; apps
in order: `x7_onoff` (soft P=800 on activate / P=5 on deactivate, clamp goal to present),
`x7_read` (stream all present values), `x7_set_param` (gains, profiles, return-delay),
`x7_move_simple` (one-joint min-jerk with limit clamps + the two-layer watchdog below).
**Loss-of-comms safety — two layers, because the host cannot transmit anything once the
link is dead:** (1) *servo-side* Bus Watchdog (register 98) armed on activate (e.g. 100 ms
= value 5); `activate()` reads Firmware Version (register 6) and treats firmware < v38
(no Bus Watchdog support) as activation failure. The watchdog counts ALL instruction
packets, so ongoing sync reads keep it fed even when writes stall; therefore (2) the
*host-side* watchdog independently tracks time since the last successful COMMAND write /
controller update — even while reads succeed — and on staleness ESCALATES: best-effort
zero commands + deactivate, then, whether or not those writes succeeded, STOP ALL BUS
TRAFFIC and close the port so the servo Bus Watchdog necessarily fires (continuing reads
would otherwise keep feeding it while failed safety writes leave torque on). Plus
missed-cycle/stale-read handling. `deactivate()` is NOT an e-stop: hardware sessions
require an independent actuator-power cutoff within arm's reach, stated in the runbook.
✓ Each app against pty emulator in CI first, incl. emulated Bus Watchdog timeout AND the
reads-alive/writes-stalled trap case — acceptance is the MOTOR's end state: host watchdog
fires, escalation goes bus-silent, and the emulated motor verifiably stops / enters Bus
Watchdog error (not merely "host watchdog triggered"); then physical checklist on
/dev/ttyUSB0, wrist joint (ID 8) before all joints. No motion on activate; halting all
bus traffic (USB unplug) → servo stops autonomously via Bus Watchdog, confirmed by state
read-back after reconnect.

**M6 — Position-control parity with rt_manipulators (DONE; `examples/x7_wave` confirmed
on the physical arm 2026-07-21 — see docs/PARITY.md for the full feature mapping).** Full `CraneX7Hardware`: TOML joint
groups, background read→limit→write thread (liwPAction or timerfd), all getters/setters,
gain/profile writers, validation rule (writing velocity/current requires reading position),
zero-on-stop, `Arm` adapter. Port vendor samples01–03 to `examples/`.
✓ Catch2 (pty): 60 s thread loop with missed-deadline budget, limit-clamp properties,
watchdog, validation rejections. Parity checklist mapping every vendor feature to a
test/example. Manual: examples reproduce vendor sample behavior on the real arm.

**M7 — Current-based torque estimation + gravity compensation (DONE — sim:
finite-difference gradient check, float acceptance <0.05 rad/10 s; hardware 2026-07-21:
`apps/x7_float` floats and is back-drivable, measured vs predicted torque within
~0.01–0.03 Nm per joint at static poses; friction identification remains the open
follow-up).** `conversions.hpp`
torque↔current (2.409 / 1.783 Nm/A); `JointState.tau` from PresentCurrent; gravity term via
`ChainModel::gravityTorque(q8)`: expand canonical 8 → 9 model coordinates via JointMap
(finger_b = finger_a), call `rkChainID_G(chain, q9, zeroVel9, zeroAcc9, RK_GRAVITY6D,
trq9)` with member-owned zero vectors sized `rkChainJointSize` — NEVER null
(`rkChainSetJointRateAll` dereferences both unconditionally, `rk_chain.c:478`, `:334`) —
then reduce 9 → 8 through the constraint Jacobian transpose: with mimic multiplier 1,
canonical gripper torque = τ_finger_a + τ_finger_b (summed, not finger_a alone).
Regression tests cover the null-vector call path, coordinate projection (8→9→8) and the
force mapping via the virtual-work identity τ₈ᵀδq₈ = τ₉ᵀδq₉ as separate checks. `GravityComp` controller in Current mode. Friction identification starts here
(dzco `dz_ident_lag`), feeding the ztk friction params.
✓ Sim first via bridge: drift <0.05 rad over 10 s under gravity comp; same binary on
hardware — arm floats, back-drivable. Static-pose tau vs `rkChainID_G` prediction, document
per-joint error (~20–30 % expected, friction unmodeled).

**M8 — Torque control via inverse dynamics (DONE — sim: tracking RMS 0.0050 rad,
3.1× tighter than bare PD, asserted by test; hardware: RMS 0.019/0.022 rad at the
reduced-speed acceptance envelope, 2026-07-21).**
Computed-torque tracking
`tau = ID_G(q_d, dq_d, ddq_d) + Kp·e + Kd·ė`, current clamped to CurrentLimit − margin,
optional dzco PID/filter blocks; runs through Runner unchanged sim→real.
✓ Sim: tracking RMS below threshold on the M2 trajectory, ID+PD vs PD-only comparison.
Hardware: reduced speed, conservative clamps; safety = M5's two-layer watchdog plus the
independent actuator-power cutoff (deactivate() is not an e-stop).
*Hardware campaign notes (nine runs, 2026-07-21, eight logged as `trackN.csv`):* the textbook law above is NOT
hardware-stable as written; the shipped controller became
`tau = ID + LP(scale_i·(Kp e + Kd ė_host)) + clamp(Ki ∫e)` — every added term traces to
a logged failure: the servo's PresentVelocity estimate (~50 ms lag, 2× attenuation)
destabilizes Kd, so velocity is estimated host-side from positions; the ~13 Hz gear-train
resonance forces the low-pass on the PD (and caps Kp ≈ 6); the resulting friction sag
(~1 Nm) needs the clamped integrator; per-joint gain scales keep the low-inertia distal
joints (forearm twist worst, hand mass on-axis) out of ~5 Hz backlash limit cycles; a
damped, quiescence-gated settle phase precedes tracking; feedback positions wrap to the
principal angle (multi-turn readout otherwise poisons the soft-limit gates). Also
live-validated: read-failure escalation (frozen-feedback trap) and both watchdog layers.
*Known limitation:* excursions beyond scale ≈ 0.6 extend the arm into configurations
whose ~4–5 Hz structural mode (shoulder gear compliance vs arm inertia) the 100 Hz loop
actively pumps — runs 7–8 oscillated coherently there even at matched trajectory rates.
`x7_track` caps its scale accordingly. Lifting the cap requires mode identification plus
a notch/input shaper (natural companion to the M7 friction-identification follow-up), or
position-mode tracking for large fast motions. Full detail:
`docs/theory/computed-torque.md` (hardware-reality section) and the apps' headers.

## Post-completion hardening (2026-07-21 external review)

An external review after plan completion found four defects, all fixed with regression
tests, and two overclaims, resolved as intentional deviations (annotated at M4 and in
docs/PARITY.md):

1. *Deadman blind to a stalled controller* — the background thread's own successful
   retransmissions refreshed the write timestamp, so a frozen controller left its last
   velocity/current command active forever. `setTarget*` now stamps a submission time the
   thread cannot refresh; once a controller has submitted, submissions must stay fresh or
   the deadman escalates (monitor-only sessions that never submit are exempt).
2. *Activation and lifetime not fail-safe* — a mid-sequence `activate()` failure now
   best-effort releases every servo (no partially torqued arm), `RealArm::activate()`
   deactivates if the thread fails to start, and `~CraneX7()` joins a still-running
   thread (deliberately without torque-off: a silent bus lets the servo watchdogs freeze
   the arm, which beats an uncommanded gravity drop).
3. *Unvalidated boundaries* — `Config::load()` now rejects anything but the exact
   canonical deployment (count, order-by-name, ids, known models, valid modes, positive
   limits), and all command writers/target setters reject size-mismatched vectors instead
   of indexing limit arrays out of bounds.
4. *Emulator watchdog fidelity* — real XM firmware only monitors the bus interval while
   torque is enabled; the emulator now gates its Bus Watchdog on TorqueEnable and the
   watchdog tests torque up first (plus a regression that torque-off silence never trips).

Intentional and recorded, not fixed: single ordered all-joint group (vs the vendor's
named multi-groups), partial gain-writer surface, `GroupSyncRead` instead of
FastSyncRead, and `dxl_inspect`'s built-in register table instead of `.model` parsing —
see docs/PARITY.md "Consciously simplified or not ported".

## Git workflow

**Conventional Commits** (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), one commit per
coherent, appropriately-sized change — never one commit per milestone. Types: `feat`,
`fix`, `build`, `test`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`; scope = layer or area, e.g.
`feat(dxl): add indirect-address sync group`, `build(cmake): add FindMiLib module`,
`feat(model): port CRANE-X7 URDF to ztk`, `test(emu): cover torque-enable gating`,
`feat(arm): define sim/real bridge interface`, `chore(tools): set up uv project`.
Guideline per milestone: M0 ≈ 3–4 commits (scaffold, FindMiLib, DynamixelSDK wiring,
Catch2/CTest); larger milestones commit per module + its tests together (test code lands
with the feature it tests, `test:` type reserved for test-only changes).

## Risks / open questions

1. ~~Mesh paths CWD-relative~~ **Resolved at M1:** mi-lib viewers (rk_pen/rk_anim/rk_view)
   chdir into the model's directory before reading, so imports are written relative to the
   .ztk itself (`meshes/...`) and `ChainModel` mirrors the same chdir convention on load.
2. **urdf2ztk inertia fidelity** (URDF inertial origin rpy → roki tensor) — numeric
   comparison test at M1. Mimic tag silently dropped — handled by penalty coupling (M3).
3. **xacro standalone**: if pip xacro rejects `$(find …)` + ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, fallback is a
   thin top-level xacro including `crane_x7.xacro` by relative path (skips ros2_control/
   gazebo blocks — cleaner output anyway).
4. **Realtime**: 9-servo FastSyncRead + SyncWrite ≪2 ms/cycle → 100–200 Hz safe; overrun
   counters in M6; document `latency_timer=1` udev rule for ftdi_sio.
5. **Current ≠ torque** (friction, gear efficiency): M7 measures the gap; per-joint
   friction feedforward later (params identified in M7, then stored in the ztk).
6. **Pty emulator replies instantly** — inject artificial delays for watchdog tests; final
   latency validation stays on hardware (M5).
7. **XM540 vs XM430 deltas** (CurrentLimit defaults, stall ratings) — encode per-model in
   ControlTable, cross-check `.model` files at M4.
8. ~~Finger penalty coupling is a stiff term~~ **Resolved at M3:** reflected motor inertia
   on the mass-matrix diagonal plus overdamped coupling; thresholds documented in the
   SimArm options and the acceptance test.
9. **mi-lib C++ (`_cpp`) library variants miscompile the zm/roki-fd ODE path** (stock
   roki-fd example heap-corrupts against them, zm 1.14.5) — rtctrl links the C libraries
   and defines the C++-only static class members in `src/milib_cpp_compat.cpp`. Worth an
   upstream report.

## Verification summary

Per milestone above; overall: `ctest -L unit` (fast, no devices), `ctest -L integration`
(pty emulator + plain-roki dynamics sim), manual visual checks with `rk_pen`/`rk_anim`, and the staged
hardware checklist (M5→M8) with safety gates (soft gains, clamps, Bus Watchdog + host
watchdog, independent power cutoff) proven against the emulator before each hardware step.
